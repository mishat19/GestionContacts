----------------------**WELCOME TO MY C# PROJECT**----------------------

This is a modified school project whose goal was to create a Windows form to familiarize students with Visual Studio, C#, and .NET.

The user can primarily **add, delete, or modify** a simple contact (first name, last name, number of children, and children's first names).

However, I wanted to add a contact backup system, so I added a **.JSON file** to my program.

But my curiosity gave me the idea of ​​creating **an executable program** to learn how to do this. After creating this, I tried to make the .JSON file functional because it wasn't working since it was stored in ProgramFiles, so I made sure it was stored in AppData along with all the user data. By the way, you can **import your own contact.json** file to work on a new device.
